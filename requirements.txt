# - json
# - os
# - tkinter (for GUI - included in Python standard library)

# Optional: For enhanced functionality, you could add:
# numpy==1.24.3          # For advanced signal processing
# matplotlib==3.7.2       # For signal visualization
# scipy==1.11.1          # For signal analysis
# pyqt5==5.15.9          # For alternative GUI (optional)
